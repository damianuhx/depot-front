# README #

* This app was developed for a group of people that want to order food regularly that is not available in common food shops. So the shopping lists of the members are collected once a month and then big orders at different food producers are made. This app lets users create their shopping lists and creates order lists for the food producers automatically.

### What is this repository for? ###

* This is the front-end part of a RESTful application to organise ordering food for a group of people. The back-end part of this application can be found [here](https://github.com/damianuhx/depot). 

### How do I get set up? ###

* This is a node app built with quasar. Read below how to install a Quasar app using yarn.
* The only variable that must be changed in order to run on your server is baseURL in src/boot/axios.js. Define the URL to the app here.
